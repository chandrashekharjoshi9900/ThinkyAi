## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chandrashekharjoshi9900/ThinkyAi.git
    ```
    *(Note: Please replace `ThinkyAi` with your actual repository name.)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ThinkyAi
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

You need to set up environment variables for Firebase and the Gemini API.

1.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.

2.  **Add Firebase & Gemini Credentials:**
    Your `.env.local` file should look like this. Fill in your actual keys.

    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration (for the client-side)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIza..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project.appspot.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="1234567890"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:12345:web:abcd"

    # Gemini API Key (for the server-side API route)
    GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

**Note:** The `.env.local` file is already included in the default Next.js `.gitignore` file, so your keys will not be committed to Git.

```bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
